Add a resources/scripts/ directory to store scripts for dynamic level components
	Most levels could then have a level-{{level_title}}.py script and can load more general-use scripts like an icy-terrain.py script
	Each level config can then specify which scripts need to be loaded
Determine how to allow Python code in level config files for dynamic text and level events
